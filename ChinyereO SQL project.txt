Annabel Miller and Jeremy Bowers checked in on 9th January, 2018.

The murder was committed by Jeremy Bowers, according to the two witnesses.

I went further to confirm if Jeremy attended the facebook event "Funky grooves tour"

select f.person_id, f.event_name, f.date, p.name, p.id 
from facebook_event_checkin f
join person P
on p.id = f.person_id
where p.name = "Jeremy Bowers"
The code returned the following result

"67318"	"The Funky Grooves Tour"	"20180115"	"Jeremy Bowers"	"67318"
"67318"	"SQL Symphony Concert"	"20171206"	"Jeremy Bowers"	"67318"

The above result confirms that Jeremy was present in the facebook event of 20180115.

I went on to see if there was an interview with Jeremy in order to know the motive of the murder.

select person_id, transcript from interview
where person_id = 67318

The above code returned the following result:

"67318"	"I was hired by a woman with a lot of money. I don't know her name but I know she's around 5'5"" (65"") or 5'7"" (67""). She has red hair and she drives a Tesla Model S. I know that she attended the SQL Symphony Concert 3 times in December 2017."

Following Jeremy Bowers confession, I went on to look up the information on the woman who allegedly hired him to commit the murder.

select d.height, d.hair_color, d.gender, d.car_make, f.event_name, p.name, f.date
from drivers_license d
join person p
on   d.id = p.license_id
join facebook_event_checkin f
on f.person_id = p.id
where event_name = "SQL Symphony Concert" 
AND (f.date BETWEEN 20171201 AND 20171231)
and d.hair_color = "red"
and d.car_make = "Tesla"

The above search returned the following information:
"66"	"red"	"female"	"Tesla"	"SQL Symphony Concert"	"Miranda Priestly"	"20171206"
"66"	"red"	"female"	"Tesla"	"SQL Symphony Concert"	"Miranda Priestly"	"20171212"
"66"	"red"	"female"	"Tesla"	"SQL Symphony Concert"	"Miranda Priestly"	"20171229"
  
Evidence shows that Miranda Priestly hired Jeremy Bowers to commit the murder.
